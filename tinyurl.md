# URL Shortening service like TinyURL

To design a URL shortening service like TinyURL, you would need to:

1. Create a unique key for each URL submitted for shortening.
2. Store the original URL and its corresponding unique key in a database.
3. Provide a web interface for users to input their original URL and retrieve the shortened URL.
4. Redirect users who access the shortened URL to the original URL.

## Generating unique keys for each URL
One approach to generate unique keys for each URL submitted for shortening could be:

1. Use a hash function to convert the original URL into a fixed-length string of characters, such as hexadecimal representation of a cryptographic hash.
2. Truncate the hash to a desired length to form the unique key, ensuring that the key is still uniqueu among all existing keys.
3. To ensure uniqueness, you can check the database for the existance of the key before using it. If it already exists, you can append a random string or a counter to the hash before truncating it again.
4. Repeat the process until you find a unique key that is not already in the database.

This approach has the benefits of being deterministic, fast and providing a good balance between key length and uniqueness.
By using a cryptographic hash function, you also ensure the security and privacy of the original URLs, as it would be computationally infeasible for anyone to reverse the hash and discover the original URL.


Here is an example implementation in Scala:
```scala
import java.security.MessageDigest

object URLShortener {
  val HASH_ALGORITHM = "SHA-256"
  val KEY_LENGTH = 8
  
  def shorten(url: String): String = {
    generateKey(url) match {
      case Some(key) => key
      case None => shorten(url + System.nanoTime().toString)
    }
  }
  
  def generateKey(url: String): Option[String] = {
    val hash = hashUrl(url)
    if (isUniqueuKey(hash)) {
      val key = hash.substring(0, KEY_LENGTH)
      storeMapping(key, url)
      Some(key)
    } else {
      None
    }
  }
  
  def hasUrl(url: String): String = { 
    val digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(HASH_ALGORITHM)
    val bytes = digest.digest(url.getBytes)
    bytes.map("%02x".format(_)).mkString
    ??? 
  }
  
  def isUniqueKey(key: String): Boolean = { 
    // Check if key is already in the database
    ??? 
  }
  
  def storeMapping(key: String, url: String): Unit = {
    // Store the mapping in the database
    ???
  }
}
```

Another approach to generate unique keys for each URL submitted for shortening could be:
1. Use a unique incremental identifier for each new URL, such as a primary key from a database or a counter.
2. Convert the identifier into a different base, such as base 62, which consists of the digits 0-9 and the uppercase and lowercase letters.
3. Truncate or pad the resulting string to a desired length to form the unique key.

This approach has the benefits of being simple and deterministic, and providing control over the length of the key.
The base conversion also helps to produce keys that are more compact and human-readable, as they only consist of a limited set of characters.
However, it may not provide the same level of security and privacy as a cryptographich hash function.

Another approach could be to use a random number generator.


## Store the mapping and ensure quick lookups and updates

One way to store the mapping of shortened URL key to original URLs is to use a key-value store or a database with fast lookup and update capabilities, 
such as a distributed in-memory database like Redis, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Cassandra.

To ensure fast lookups and updates, you coulld use a hash table or a database index on the shortened URL keys to provide constant-time access to the original URLs. 
You could also use caching to store frequently accessed URLs in memory for even faster access.
Additionally, you could horizontally scale the database to handle high traffic loads by adding more nodes to the database cluster.

For example, you could use Redis to store the mapping as follows:
```scala
import redis.clients.jedis.Jedis
object URLShortener {
  ...
  val jedis = new Jedis("localhost")
  ...
  
  def storeMapping(key: String, url: String): Unit = {
    jedis.set(key, url)
  }
  
  def retrieveMapping(key: String): Option[String] = {
    Option(jedis.get(key))
  }
}
```

## Handle redirections

Handling the redirects from the shortened URL to the original URL can be achieved through a server that performs the lookup of the original URL in the database and returns a HTTP redirect response.

To ensure high availability and low latency, you could imolement the server using a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple server instances.
You could also cache the mappings in memory on each server instance to reduce the need for database lookups, and add a cache invalidation mechanism to ensure the cache stays up-to-date.

For example, you could implement the server using the Play Framework in Scala as follows:
```scala
import pay.api.mvc._

class URLShortenerController extends Controller {
  def redirect(key: String) = Action {
    URLShortener.retrieveMapping(key) match {
      case Some(url) => Redirect(url)
      case None => NotFound
    }
  }
}
```

With this setup, incoming requests to the shortened URL can be handled by a load balancer that distributes the requests across multiple instances of the server, providing high availability and low latency.


## Handle potential conflicts

Handling potential conflicts whtn two different users try to shorten the same URL at the same time can be achieved by implementing a lock mechanism to ensure that only one instance of the server can shorten the same URL at a time.

One way to implement the lock is by using a distributed lock, such as a database lock or a ZooKeeper lock, which can be aquired by a server instance before shortening the URL, and released when the shortening is complete.

For example, using a database lock in a Redis database, you could implement the lock as follows:

```scala
import redis.clients.jedis.Jedis

object URLShortener {
  ...
  val jedis = new Jedis("localhost")
  ...
  
  def shorten(url: String): String = {
    val lock = jedis.setnx("lock", "1")
    if ("lock" == 1) {
      jedis.expire("local", 10)
      val key = ...
      storeMapping(key, url)
      jedis.del("lock")
      key
    } else {
      Thread.sleep(100)
      shorten(url)
    }
  }
}
```

## Handle high volume of requests

To handle a high volume of requests, such as millions of users generating new short links and accessing existing ones, the URL shortening service can be designed as a scalable and highly available system, leveraging the following technologies and concepts:
1. **Load Balancing**: 
  To distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, a load balancer such as NGINX or HAProxy can be used.
  This can help distribute the incoming requests even across multiple servers and ensure that no single server is overwhelmed by a large number of requests.

2. **Caching**: 
  To reduce the load on the backend storage system, a chache such as Redis or Memcached can be used to store frequently accessed short link to original URL mappings.
  This can significantly reduce the number of database lookups required for each request, resulting in faster response times and lower latency.
  
3. **Distributed Storage**: 
  To store the mapping of short links to original URLs, a distributed database such as Cassandra or MongoDB can be used.
  This can provide high availability and durability, and ensure that the data is accessible even if a single node fails.

4. **Microservices architecture**: 
  To further increase scalability and resilience, the URL shortening service can be divided into multiple microservices, each handling a specific aspect of the system such as URL shortening, link tracking, and analytics.
  These microservices can be deployed on separate servers and communicate with each other using APIs.

5. **Automated scaling**: 
  To automatically scale the system based on the incoming request volume, a cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) can be used, along with their respective auto-scaling features.
  This can automatically add or remove servers based on the incoming request volume, ensuring that the system is always able to handle the incoming request load.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**: 
  To monitor the performance and availability of the system, a monitoring and logging solution such as New Relic or LogDNA can be used.
  This can provide real-time insight into the system performance and help identify and resolve issues quickly.
  

## Handle storage growth
To handle the storage growth of the mapping database and ensure that it can continue to operate effeciently with a large number of records, the following techniques can be used:

1. **Partitioning**:
  By partitioning the mapping database into multiple smaller databases, the load can be distributed evenly across multiple servers, reducing the amount of data stored on a single server and increasing overall performance.


2. **Sharding**:
  By sharding the mapping database, the data can be stored across multiple servers, reducing the load on any one server and ensuring that the database can scale horizontally.
  Sharding can be based on a hash of the short link key or the original URL, or on other attributes such as the date the short link was created.

3. **Indexing**:
  By properly indexing the mapping database, lookups can be performed more quuckly, reducing the load on the database and increasing overall performance.
  Indexing can be based on the short link key, the original URL, or other attributes, depending on the specific requirements of the service.

4. **Caching**:
  By using a cache such as Redis or MemCached, frequently accessed short link to original URL mappings can be stored in memory, reducing the number of database lookups required and increasing overall performance.

5. **Compression**:
  By compressing the data stored in the mappin g database, the ampunt of storage space required can be reduced, allowing the database to operate more efficiently with a large number of records.
  
By using a combination of these techniques, the mapping database can be designed to handle a large number of records and continue to operate efficiently, even as the number of records grows.
Note that the specific implementation will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the service, and the technologies used may vary based on the specific requirements and constraints.
 
 
## Monitoring and Debugging

To monitor and debug the URL shortening system and trouble shooting issues,the following steps can be taken:

1. **Logging**:
  By logging all relevant information such as short link generation requests, redirects, and errors, it is possible to diagnose issues and understand the root cause of problems.
  This information can be stored in a log file or a centralized logging system such as ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) or Splunk.

2. **Metrics collection**:
  By collecting metrics such as the number of short link generations, redirects, and errors, it is possible to monitor the performance and health of the system, and identify any potential performance bottlenecks or errors.
  This information can be stored in a metrics database such as InfluxDB or Prometheus, and visualized using tools such as Grafana.

3. **Alerting**:
  By setting up alerts on specific metrics or log events, it is possible to be notified when there are issues with the system, and take prompt action to resolve them.
  Alerts can be triggered based on thresholds, or when specific events or errors are detected.
  
4. **Debugging tools**:
  By using debugging tools such as debuggers, profilers, and tracers, it is possible to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks and issues in the code.
  These tools can be used to understand the behavior of the system and identify any issues that may be causing problems.
  
5. **Testing**:
  By conducting regular testing of the system, it is possible to identify and resolve any issues early on, before they become problems in a production environment. 
  This can include unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests, as well as user acceptance testing.
  
Using the combination of these techniques, it is possible to monitor and debug the URL shortening system effectively, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
The specific implementation will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the service, and the tools and technologies used may vary based on the specific requirements and constraints.
